Left an outcast, he's surrendered his birthright and been given a woman's place as apprentice to Mother Gundring, Gettland's Minister, training to be an adviser, diplomat, healer and translator. <\/p> <p>But when his father and brother are murdered by Grom-gil-Gorm, King of neighboring Vansterland, Yarvi is forced to take the Black Chair and become king himself - or half a king, at least - swear an oath of vengeance against the killers of his father, and lead a raid against the Vanstermen. Betrayed, left for dead, and enslaved on a rotting trading galley, Yarvi will need all his Minister's wit and cunning to escape, and all his diplomacy and knowledge to keep a rag-tag band of other slaves together on a month long trek across the frozen wastes of the utmost north. Among them are Sumael, the ship's single-minded navigator, Rulf, an ex-raide, Jaud, an ex-baker, and Nothing, a mad old man with a mysterious past and an almost magical skill with a sword. And their owner, the brutal Captain Shadikshirram, will be dogging their heels at every step. Father Peace may be the patron god of Ministers, but to reclaim the Black Chair, Yarvi will have to strike a deal with Mother War, and once you've invited the mother of crows to be your guest, there can be no telling whose blood will be spilled.<\/p>",

She must conquer her fears and sharpen her wits to a lethal edge if she is to reclaim her birthright. Only half a war is fought with swords. The deep-cunning Father Yarvi has walked a long road from crippled slave to king's minister. He has made allies of old foes and stitched together an uneasy peace. But now the ruthless Grandmother Wexen has raised the greatest army since the elves made war on God and put Bright Yilling at its head - a man who worships no god but Death. Sometimes one must fight evil with evil. Some - like Thorn Bathu and the sword-bearer Raith - are born to fight, perhaps to die. Others - like Brand the smith and Koll the woodcarver - would rather stand in the light. But when Mother War spreads her iron wings, she may cast the whole Shattered Sea into darkness. <\/p>",

Knights Radiant who fly too near find their Stormlight suddenly drained, so the voyage must be by sea.<\/p> <p>Shipowner Rysn Ftori lost the use of her legs but gained the companionship of Chiri-Chiri, a Stormlight-ingesting winged larkin, a species once thought extinct. Now Rysn's pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri\u2019s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed Windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani's quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The first novel in the First Law Trilogy and the debut novel from <i>New York Times<\/i> best seller Joe Abercrombie. <\/p> <p>Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he's on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian - leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. <\/p> <p>Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. <\/p> <p>Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: Cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. <\/p> <p>Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult. <\/p> <p>Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. <\/p> <p>Unpredictable, compelling, wickedly funny, and packed with unforgettable characters, <i>The Blade Itself <\/i>is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>Hugo Award-winning authors Brandon Sanderson and Mary Robinette Kowal team up in this exclusive audio-first production of <\/b><b><i>The Original<\/i><\/b><b>, a sci-fi thriller set in a world where one woman fights to know her true identity and survive the forces that threaten her very existence. <\/b><\/p> <p>In the near future, humans choose life - for a price. Injectable nanite technology is the lifeblood that flows through every individual wishing to experience the world through the lens of their own theme. While death from mortal wounds is still possible, life is made easier in a socially liberated society where automation and income equality allow passion pursuits to flourish over traditional work. Renewal stations are provided to every law-abiding citizen for weekly check-ins, which issue life-sustaining repairs in exchange for personal privacy. But what becomes of those who check out, of those who dare to resist immortality and risk being edited under the gaze of an identity-extracting government surveillance system? <\/p> <p>When Holly Winseed wakes up in a hospital room, her memory compromised and a new identity imposed on her, a team of government agents wastes no time stating their objective. With intent to infiltrate and defeat the terrorist group ICON, the agents tell Holly that she is now a Provisional Replica and has one week to hunt down and kill her Original for the murder of her husband, Jonathan. If she succeeds, she\u2019ll assume her Original\u2019s place in society. If she fails, her life will end. Holly\u2019s progress is monitored by an assigned contact that feeds her information as she confronts the blank, robotic world around her, discovering that others view life through the theme of their own choosing. <\/p> <p>With her newly implanted combat and deduction skills, Holly fends off both attacks by terrorists and doubts about her own trustworthiness as clues lead her to her Original - and to the truth about Jonathan. In the end, one body remains and one walks away. Although questions persist, one thing is certain: Life will never be the same. <\/p>",

Their world is one in which those who die in glory return as gods to live confined to a pantheon in Hallandren's capital city and where a power known as BioChromatic magic is based on an essence known as breath that can be collected only one unit at a time from individual people. By using breath and drawing upon the color in everyday objects, all manner of miracles and mischief can be accomplished. It will take considerable quantities of each to resolve all the challenges facing Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris; Susebron, the God King; Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery; and mysterious Vasher, the Warbreaker. <\/p>",

Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. <\/p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. <\/p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. <\/p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>",

But as a result, the Deepness - the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists - is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed. <\/p> <p>Having escaped death at the climax of <i>The Well of Ascension<\/i> only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans! <\/p> <p>The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.  <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>",

But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. <\/p> <p>As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable.

While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified. <\/p> <p>Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>From number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i>, book one of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.<\/p> <p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<\/p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.<\/p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<\/p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<\/p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<\/p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<\/p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:<\/p> <p>Life before death.<\/p> <p>Strength before weakness.<\/p> <p>Journey before destination.<\/p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.<\/p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p>The Cosmere<\/p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Collection:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i> <\/li> <\/ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

Jackson<\/b> (<i>Pulp Fiction<\/i>) rocks this mock bedtime story, capturing a hilarious range of emotions as the voice of a father struggling to get his child to sleep. <\/p> <p><i>Go the F--k to Sleep<\/i> is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don\u2019t always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach\u2019s profane, affectionate, and radically honest verses perfectly capture the familiar - and unspoken - tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity. <\/p> <p>Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, <i>Go the F**k to Sleep<\/i> is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children. <\/p> <p>Feel free to share the link to this page with tired parents and other people who could use a good swear and a laugh.<\/p>",

This was the first of Dickens' works to depict realistically London's impoverished underworld, and to illustrate his belief that poverty leads to crime.
