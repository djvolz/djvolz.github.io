The aliens' human collaborators may have been defeated, but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's defense plans are totally exposed to the enemy.

But Circe is a strange child - not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring, like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power - the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. <\/p> <p>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur; Daedalus and his doomed son, Icarus; the murderous Medea; and, of course, wily Odysseus. <\/p> <p>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from or the mortals she has come to love. <\/p> <p>With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and pause-resisting suspense, <i>Circe<\/i> is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, and love and loss as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.<\/p>",

Injectable nanite technology is the lifeblood that flows through every individual wishing to experience the world through the lens of their own theme. While death from mortal wounds is still possible, life is made easier in a socially liberated society where automation and income equality allow passion pursuits to flourish over traditional work. Renewal stations are provided to every law-abiding citizen for weekly check-ins, which issue life-sustaining repairs in exchange for personal privacy. But what becomes of those who check out, of those who dare to resist immortality and risk being edited under the gaze of an identity-extracting government surveillance system? <\/p> <p>When Holly Winseed wakes up in a hospital room, her memory compromised and a new identity imposed on her, a team of government agents wastes no time stating their objective. With intent to infiltrate and defeat the terrorist group ICON, the agents tell Holly that she is now a Provisional Replica and has one week to hunt down and kill her Original for the murder of her husband, Jonathan. If she succeeds, she\u2019ll assume her Original\u2019s place in society. If she fails, her life will end. Holly\u2019s progress is monitored by an assigned contact that feeds her information as she confronts the blank, robotic world around her, discovering that others view life through the theme of their own choosing. <\/p> <p>With her newly implanted combat and deduction skills, Holly fends off both attacks by terrorists and doubts about her own trustworthiness as clues lead her to her Original - and to the truth about Jonathan. In the end, one body remains and one walks away. Although questions persist, one thing is certain: Life will never be the same. <\/p>",

Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now part of history - or religion. <\/p> <p>Yet even as science and technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs, they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting to establish order and justice. One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will. <\/p> <p>After 20 years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>",

  "summary": "<p>After bursting onto the fantasy scene with his acclaimed debut novel, <i>Elantris<\/i>, and following up with his blockbuster Mistborn trilogy, Brandon Sanderson proves again that he is today's leading master of what Tolkien called \"secondary creation\", the invention of whole worlds, complete with magics and myths all their own. <\/p> <p><i>Warbreaker<\/i> is the story of two sisters who happen to be princesses, the God King one of them has to marry, the lesser god who doesn't like his job, and the immortal who's still trying to undo the mistakes he made hundreds of years ago. Their world is one in which those who die in glory return as gods to live confined to a pantheon in Hallandren's capital city and where a power known as BioChromatic magic is based on an essence known as breath that can be collected only one unit at a time from individual people. By using breath and drawing upon the color in everyday objects, all manner of miracles and mischief can be accomplished. It will take considerable quantities of each to resolve all the challenges facing Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris; Susebron, the God King; Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery; and mysterious Vasher, the Warbreaker. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>From number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action. <\/p> <p>For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible.

A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. <\/p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it.

The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified. <\/p> <p>Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization. <\/p>",

Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.<\/p> <p>The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin\u2019s master has much deeper motives. <\/p> <p>Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. <\/p> <p>Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>",

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<\/p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.<\/p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<\/p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<\/p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<\/p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<\/p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:<\/p> <p>Life before death.<\/p> <p>Strength before weakness.<\/p> <p>Journey before destination.<\/p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.<\/p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p>The Cosmere<\/p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Collection:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i> <\/li> <\/ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

Jackson<\/b> (<i>Pulp Fiction<\/i>) rocks this mock bedtime story, capturing a hilarious range of emotions as the voice of a father struggling to get his child to sleep. <\/p> <p><i>Go the F--k to Sleep<\/i> is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don\u2019t always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach\u2019s profane, affectionate, and radically honest verses perfectly capture the familiar - and unspoken - tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity. <\/p> <p>Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, <i>Go the F**k to Sleep<\/i> is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children. <\/p> <p>Feel free to share the link to this page with tired parents and other people who could use a good swear and a laugh.<\/p>",

In handsomely crafted prose and with the grace and authority of his extraordinary gift for narrative history, William Manchester leads us from a civilization tottering on the brink of collapse to the grandeur of its rebirth, the Renaissance. The latter was a dense explosion of energy that spawned some of history's greatest poets, philosophers, and painters, as well as some of its most spectacular villains.",

This was the first of Dickens' works to depict realistically London's impoverished underworld, and to illustrate his belief that poverty leads to crime. At the heart of the drama, however, is Oliver, the orphan whose unsullied goodness leads him to salvation and who represents Dickens' belief in the principle of good triumphing at last.",

Thus began their astonishing trek to freedom. <p>With no map or compass but only an ax head, a homemade knife, and a week's supply of food, the compatriots spent a year making their way on foot to British India, through 4,000 miles of the most forbidding terrain on earth. They braved the Himalayas, the desolate Siberian tundra, icy rivers, and the great Gobi Desert, always a hair's breadth from death. Finally arriving, Rawicz reenlisted in the Polish army to fight the Germans.<\/p>",
