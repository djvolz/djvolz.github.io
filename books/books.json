  "summary": "<p>From Brandon Sanderson\u2014author of the #1 New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive and its fourth massive installment, Rhythm of War\u2014comes a new hefty novella, Dawnshard. Taking place between Oathbringer and Rhythm of War, this tale (like Edgedancer before it) gives often-overshadowed characters their own chance to shine.<\/p> <p>When a ghost ship is discovered, its crew presumed dead after trying to reach the storm-shrouded island Akina, Navani Kholin must send an expedition to make sure the island hasn't fallen into enemy hands. Knights Radiant who fly too near find their Stormlight suddenly drained, so the voyage must be by sea.<\/p> <p>Shipowner Rysn Ftori lost the use of her legs but gained the companionship of Chiri-Chiri, a Stormlight-ingesting winged larkin, a species once thought extinct. Now Rysn's pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri\u2019s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed Windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani's quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.<\/p>",

Battle rages across the North, the king of the Northmen still stands firm, and there's only one man who can stop him. His oldest friend and his oldest enemy: It's time for the Bloody-Nine to come home. <\/p> <p>With too many masters and too little time, Superior Glokta is fighting a different kind of war. A secret struggle in which no one is safe and no one can be trusted. As his days with a sword are far behind him, it's fortunate that he's deadly with his remaining weapons: blackmail, threats, and torture. <\/p> <p>Jezal dan Luthar has decided that winning glory is too painful an undertaking and turned his back on soldiering for a simple life with the woman he loves. But love can be painful too - and glory has a nasty habit of creeping up on a man when he least expects it. <\/p> <p>The king of the Union lies on his deathbed, the peasants revolt, and the nobles scramble to steal his crown. No one believes that the shadow of war is about to fall across the heart of the Union. Only the First of the Magi can save the world, but there are risks. There is no risk more terrible than to break the First Law.... <\/p>",

Jackson's gift for characterizations shines - she brings out the humor and heroism in Spensa's young classmates and friends (and the neurotic spaceship MBOT), along with the pain and perseverance of the generations that came before them. This is a high-octane futuristic narrative of hope, sacrifice, and courage, and a fast pace speaks to the rising urgency as war rages above the planet. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\" (<i>AudioFile<\/i> magazine)<\/p> <p>From Brandon Sanderson, the number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author of the Reckoners series, <i>Words of Radiance<\/i>, and the internationally best-selling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future.  <\/p> <p>Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none.  <\/p> <p>No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>Hugo Award-winning authors Brandon Sanderson and Mary Robinette Kowal team up in this exclusive audio-first production of <\/b><b><i>The Original<\/i><\/b><b>, a sci-fi thriller set in a world where one woman fights to know her true identity and survive the forces that threaten her very existence. <\/b><\/p> <p>In the near future, humans choose life - for a price. Injectable nanite technology is the lifeblood that flows through every individual wishing to experience the world through the lens of their own theme. While death from mortal wounds is still possible, life is made easier in a socially liberated society where automation and income equality allow passion pursuits to flourish over traditional work. Renewal stations are provided to every law-abiding citizen for weekly check-ins, which issue life-sustaining repairs in exchange for personal privacy. But what becomes of those who check out, of those who dare to resist immortality and risk being edited under the gaze of an identity-extracting government surveillance system? <\/p> <p>When Holly Winseed wakes up in a hospital room, her memory compromised and a new identity imposed on her, a team of government agents wastes no time stating their objective. With intent to infiltrate and defeat the terrorist group ICON, the agents tell Holly that she is now a Provisional Replica and has one week to hunt down and kill her Original for the murder of her husband, Jonathan. If she succeeds, she\u2019ll assume her Original\u2019s place in society. If she fails, her life will end. Holly\u2019s progress is monitored by an assigned contact that feeds her information as she confronts the blank, robotic world around her, discovering that others view life through the theme of their own choosing. <\/p> <p>With her newly implanted combat and deduction skills, Holly fends off both attacks by terrorists and doubts about her own trustworthiness as clues lead her to her Original - and to the truth about Jonathan. In the end, one body remains and one walks away. Although questions persist, one thing is certain: Life will never be the same. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>After bursting onto the fantasy scene with his acclaimed debut novel, <i>Elantris<\/i>, and following up with his blockbuster Mistborn trilogy, Brandon Sanderson proves again that he is today's leading master of what Tolkien called \"secondary creation\", the invention of whole worlds, complete with magics and myths all their own. <\/p> <p><i>Warbreaker<\/i> is the story of two sisters who happen to be princesses, the God King one of them has to marry, the lesser god who doesn't like his job, and the immortal who's still trying to undo the mistakes he made hundreds of years ago. Their world is one in which those who die in glory return as gods to live confined to a pantheon in Hallandren's capital city and where a power known as BioChromatic magic is based on an essence known as breath that can be collected only one unit at a time from individual people. By using breath and drawing upon the color in everyday objects, all manner of miracles and mischief can be accomplished. It will take considerable quantities of each to resolve all the challenges facing Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris; Susebron, the God King; Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery; and mysterious Vasher, the Warbreaker. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>From number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action. <\/p> <p>For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. <\/p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. <\/p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. <\/p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>",

Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans! <\/p> <p>The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight.

And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization. <\/p>",

Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>",

  "summary": "<p>From number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i>, book one of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.<\/p> <p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<\/p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.<\/p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<\/p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<\/p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<\/p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<\/p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:<\/p> <p>Life before death.<\/p> <p>Strength before weakness.<\/p> <p>Journey before destination.<\/p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.<\/p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p>The Cosmere<\/p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Collection:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i> <\/li> <\/ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Academy Award nominee <b>Samuel L. Jackson<\/b> (<i>Pulp Fiction<\/i>) rocks this mock bedtime story, capturing a hilarious range of emotions as the voice of a father struggling to get his child to sleep. <\/p> <p><i>Go the F--k to Sleep<\/i> is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don\u2019t always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach\u2019s profane, affectionate, and radically honest verses perfectly capture the familiar - and unspoken - tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity. <\/p> <p>Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, <i>Go the F**k to Sleep<\/i> is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children. <\/p> <p>Feel free to share the link to this page with tired parents and other people who could use a good swear and a laugh.<\/p>",

This was the first of Dickens' works to depict realistically London's impoverished underworld, and to illustrate his belief that poverty leads to crime.
